//! Ethernaut 16 — Preservation.
//!
//! Goal: Take ownership of `Preservation`, a timezone-recording contract that
//! uses two `LibraryContract` instances.
//!
//
// Upstream hint:
//
// This contract utilizes a library to store two different times for two
// different
// timezones. The constructor creates two instances of the library for each
// time
// to be stored.
//
// The goal of this level is for you to claim ownership of the instance you
// are given.
//
// &nbsp; Things that might help
// * Look into Solidity's documentation on the `delegatecall` low level
// function,
// how it works, how it can be used to delegate operations to on-chain.
// libraries, and what implications it has on execution scope.
// * Understanding what it means for `delegatecall` to be context-preserving.
// * Understanding how storage variables are stored and accessed.
// * Understanding how casting works between different data types.
